Faction Quest Proposals - Weavers, Artificers, Purifiers
=========================================================

Each faction has 3 questlines (A, B, C) with 1 tier-1 and 1 tier-2 quest each (6 quests total).
Tier-2 quests require two tier-1 quests and use an evolved hero from a different questline.
Cross-references: A2 uses B's evolved hero, B2 uses C's evolved hero, C2 uses A's evolved hero.
Tier-2 quests target an enemy faction's base.

Each decision has:
  - Hero outcome: evolution with stat changes + new ability
  - Other outcome: faction upgrade, unit buff, income bonus, or one-time effect

Reference format: UnitName (HP/DMG/Range, abilities)

      Strike 4", which deals 4 damage to all enemies within 1 hex

      anyone who hits it. Synergizes with Purifier identity of
      benefiting from pain.)

      Avengers "Passive Armor 1". (Avengers survive longer to stack
      Lament Ramp.)

      damage through Lament Aura when allies fall.)
    Other outcome: Gain the "Congregation" upgrade, which gives Priests
      +4 HP (3 -> 7). (Priests survive long enough to actually use
      their powerful Heal 3 repeatedly.)

  Decision 2:
    Hero outcome: Apostle -> Flagellant; gains +4 DMG and "Lament Self
      Ramp 3 Range 3", which increases this unit's damage by 3 whenever
      an ally within 3 hexes dies. (Snowballing damage monster fueled
      by ally deaths. Combined with base Lament Aura, each death both
      ramps Flagellant and buffs nearby allies.)
    Other outcome: Gain the "Righteous Fury" upgrade, which gives all
      units "Wounded Self Ramp 1". (The entire army grows stronger when
      taking damage, not just Penitents.)

    Hero outcome: Martyr/Inquisitor -> Saint; gains +16 HP and "Lament
      Area 4 Fortify 2", which increases the max HP of all allies within
      4 hexes by 2 whenever an allied unit dies. (The army literally
      grows stronger through sacrifice. Each fallen Penitent or Blade
      makes survivors permanently tougher.)
    Other outcome: Gain the "Martyrdom" upgrade, which makes winning a
      combat bring all your units that died in the combat back to life
      on the overworld.

  Decision 2:
    Hero outcome: Martyr/Inquisitor -> Wrath; gains +8 DMG and
      "Turnstart Shadowstep", which teleports this unit adjacent to the
      furthest enemy at the start of each turn. (Aggressive assassination
      from the backline. 11 damage at range 5 diving into the enemy,
      with Lament abilities triggering as allies die behind her.)
    Other outcome: Destroy the base. Gain the "Holy Fire" upgrade,
      which gives all units "Endturn Area [Range] Strike 1". (The
      entire army deals 1 damage to all enemies within range every
      turn, creating unavoidable attrition.)
