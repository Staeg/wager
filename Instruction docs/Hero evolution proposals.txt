Hero Evolution Proposals - Novel Abilities
==========================================

Proposals for 4 T2 (first evolution) and 4 T3 (second evolution) hero
evolutions per starting hero. This is twice the number needed for the final
game so the best options can be selected. Each tier has 2 tanky (+HP) and
2 offensive (+DMG) paths.

Focus: novel mechanics and gameplay patterns not yet present in the game.
Many of these are deliberately ambitious or unhinged; numbers can be tuned.

Stat budget:
  T2: +8 HP or +4 DMG (occasionally +1 Range)
  T3: +16 HP or +8 DMG

CUSTODIANS
=======================================================================

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Watcher (30/8/1/2, Passive Armor 3) - Armored melee wall
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

T2 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Aegis (+8 HP -> 38/8/1/2)
     Gains "Passive Redirect Aura 2": all damage that would be dealt to
     allies within 2 hexes is dealt to this unit instead. (True tank. The
     38 HP Armor 3 wall absorbs all punishment meant for nearby allies.
     Creates a positional anchor - the army clusters behind the Aegis and
     lets it soak everything.)

  2. Thornguard (+4 DMG -> 30/12/1/2)
     Gains "Passive Reflect 4": whenever this unit is attacked, the
     attacker takes 4 damage regardless of range. (Punishes anyone who
     hits the armored wall, even ranged units 5 hexes away. Forces the
     enemy to choose between hitting a target that bites back or ignoring
     the dangerous melee tank entirely.)

  3. Obelisk (+8 HP -> 38/8/1/2)
     Gains "Wounded Adaptive Armor 1": each time this unit takes damage,
     permanently gain +1 armor for the rest of combat. (Starts at Armor 3
     and climbs. After absorbing 5 hits: Armor 8, making chip damage
     meaningless. Punishes attrition strategies and rewards the enemy for
     ignoring it - which they can't afford to do.)

  4. Undertow (+4 DMG -> 30/12/1/2)
     Gains "Endturn Vortex 3": at end of turn, pull all enemies within 3
     hexes 1 hex closer to this unit. (Inverse of Push. Drags enemies
     into melee where the Watcher excels. Prevents kiting, disrupts
     formations, and clusters enemies together for allied splash or area
     effects.)

T3 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Bastion (+16 HP)
     Gains "Passive Root Aura 2": enemies within 2 hexes cannot move.
     They can still attack if targets are in their range, but cannot
     reposition. (No-escape zone. Once melee enemies engage the 46-54 HP
     armored wall, they're trapped forever. Ranged enemies caught inside
     lose all positioning options. Devastating with allied AoE on the
     immobilized cluster.)

  2. Colossus (+16 HP)
     Gains "Passive Formation Aura 1": this unit gains +2 armor for each
     adjacent ally. Each adjacent ally gains +1 damage. (With 3 adjacent
     allies: +6 armor on top of base Armor 3 = Armor 9, functionally
     invincible. Rewards tight formations. The Colossus is a fortress
     that makes everything around it stronger while becoming nearly
     impervious.)

  3. Cataclysm (+8 DMG)
     Gains "On Death: Death Nova 3": when this unit dies, deal damage
     equal to this unit's max HP to all enemies within 3 hexes. (A 38-46
     HP bomb. Kill it and suffer 38-46 area damage. Leave it alive and
     eat 12-20 damage per turn from its attacks. The opponent faces a
     lose-lose dilemma with no clean answer.)

  4. Monolith (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Endturn Barrier Aura 3": at end of turn, grant all allies
     within 3 hexes a shield of 4 temporary HP. Shields absorb damage
     before real HP, don't stack, and refresh each turn. (Renewable
     buffer that effectively gives nearby allies +4 effective HP per
     round. Keeps fragile allies alive through one extra hit each turn
     without permanently inflating their health pools.)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Neophyte (12/6/4/2, Harvest Area Fortify 1) - Ranged scavenger
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

T2 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Curator (+8 HP -> 20/6/4/2)
     Gains "Harvest Convert 4": when an enemy dies within 4 hexes, raise
     a copy of that enemy as an allied unit with 1 HP, retaining all of
     its original abilities. (Quality depends entirely on what you fight.
     A converted Golem has 1 HP but keeps Armor 2. A converted Savant has
     1 HP but keeps Splash 1. Wildly variable and chaotic.)

  2. Hexbinder (+4 DMG -> 12/10/4/2)
     Gains "Onhit Doom 4": the hit enemy is Doomed. After 4 more of its
     own turns, it instantly dies regardless of HP. Doom is cleansed only
     if the unit is healed to full HP. One Doom active at a time. (Time
     bomb. Forces the opponent to either heal to full - nearly impossible
     for most factions - or accept an inevitable loss. Creates desperate
     urgency around the marked target.)

  3. Archivist (+4 DMG, +1 Range -> 12/10/5/2)
     Gains "Onhit Mark": the hit enemy is Marked until end of round. All
     damage Marked enemies take from any source is increased by 3. (Focus
     fire coordinator. The Archivist tags a priority target from range 5,
     then every ally that hits it deals +3 bonus damage. Turns the whole
     army into a precision kill squad.)

  4. Antiquarian (+8 HP -> 20/6/4/2)
     Gains "Endturn Wither [Range]": at end of turn, all enemies within
     attack range permanently lose 1 max HP. Current HP drops too if
     above new max. (Slow but inevitable decay. After 5 turns, every
     enemy in range has lost 5 max HP. Combined with Harvest Fortify
     growing YOUR army's HP, the health gap widens relentlessly in both
     directions.)

T3 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Gravewarden (+16 HP)
     Gains "Harvest 3 Resurrect 6": for every 3 enemies that die within
     6 hexes, resurrect a random dead ally at half HP adjacent to this
     unit. (Reverses army attrition. As the battle grinds and enemies
     fall, your own casualties return. Incredibly powerful in prolonged
     fights. The longer the battle, the more the Gravewarden tilts it.)

  2. Usurper (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Onkill Assimilate": when this unit kills an enemy, permanently
     gain all of that enemy's abilities for the rest of combat. (Kill a
     Golem, gain Armor 2. Kill a Savant, gain Splash 1. Kill a Priest,
     gain Heal 3. The Usurper becomes a chimera of stolen power,
     increasingly versatile and dangerous with each kill.)

  3. Chronarch (+16 HP)
     Gains "Endturn Cascade 4": at end of turn, trigger the endturn
     abilities of all allied units within 4 hexes an additional time.
     (Doubles every nearby endturn effect. Librarian sunders twice. Kitboy
     heals twice. Artillery fires twice. A meta-ability that amplifies
     the entire army's existing endturn toolkit without doing anything
     on its own.)

  4. Dirge (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Passive Soul Accumulator 6": track all enemy deaths within
     6 hexes - total across all turns, never resets. At end of each turn,
     deal 1 damage per accumulated soul to a random enemy within range.
     (Starts at 0 and snowballs. By turn 6, if 8 enemies have died
     nearby, the Dirge deals 8 random damage per turn. A ticking death
     toll that accelerates as the enemy army thins.)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Accursed (16/8/1/2, Onkill Self Heal 8) - Melee lifesteal duelist
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

T2 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Ghoul (+8 HP -> 24/8/1/2)
     Gains "Onkill Devour": when this unit kills an enemy, permanently
     add the killed unit's max HP to this unit's max HP and heal for that
     amount. (Kill a 16 HP Golem, become 40 HP. Kill a 32 HP Mercenary,
     become 72 HP. Each kill makes the Ghoul dramatically harder to bring
     down. Combined with Onkill Heal 8 for double recovery on every
     kill.)

  2. Corruptor (+4 DMG -> 16/12/1/2)
     Gains "Onhit Siphon 2": when attacking, permanently steal 2 base
     damage from the target. Target's damage decreases by 2, this unit's
     damage increases by 2. (Double swing. After 3 hits on the same
     target: +6 damage gained, target has -6 damage. The Corruptor grows
     monstrous while its victim becomes harmless. Devastating in extended
     melee duels.)

  3. Spectre (+8 HP -> 24/8/1/2)
     Gains "Wounded Phase": after taking damage, this unit becomes
     untargetable until its next turn. Can only be hit once per round.
     (One hit per round maximum. With 24 HP and Onkill Heal 8, the
     Spectre is nearly immortal: it absorbs one hit, heals by killing,
     and repeats. Forces the enemy to make their one shot count with
     a devastating single blow.)

  4. Blightbringer (+4 DMG -> 16/12/1/2)
     Gains "Onhit Burn 3x3": when attacking, the target gains Burn that
     deals 3 damage at the start of each of its turns for 3 turns. Burns
     from multiple attacks stack. (9 guaranteed DOT damage per attack,
     bypassing armor entirely. Hit a target twice and it takes 6 burn
     per turn. The Blightbringer doesn't even need to stay alive - the
     burns persist and finish the job.)

T3 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Sovereign (+16 HP)
     Gains "Onkill Possess": killed enemy is raised as an ally at half
     its max HP retaining all abilities. (Every kill is a double swing.
     The enemy loses a unit, you gain one at half health. Kill a healer
     and it heals YOUR army. Kill a tank and it blocks for YOUR side.
     The Sovereign assembles an army from conquered enemies.)

  2. Abomination (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Endturn Parasitic Drain 2": at end of turn, deal 2 damage to
     every enemy within 2 hexes and heal this unit for 2 per enemy hit.
     (Area vampirism. With 3 enemies in melee: 6 damage dealt, 6 HP
     healed per turn on top of Onkill Heal. Combined with melee attacks,
     the Abomination is virtually unkillable in close quarters unless
     burst down in a single round.)

  3. Dreadlord (+16 HP)
     Gains "Wounded Curse 2": when taking damage, the attacker
     permanently loses 2 base damage (minimum 0). (Cripples anyone who
     attacks it. Three different enemies swing at the Dreadlord and each
     loses 2 damage forever. Over several rounds, the entire enemy army
     is neutered. A unit that makes opponents weaker by existing.)

  4. Void Knight (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Onhit Soulbind": when this unit attacks, link with the target
     for the rest of combat. When either linked unit takes damage, the
     other takes half that damage too. Only one link at a time. (Mutual
     destruction pact. Bind to the enemy's strongest unit. Your army
     focuses the linked enemy - the Void Knight takes half the damage but
     heals through Onkill Heal. The linked enemy takes half of everything
     aimed at the Void Knight. A shared death spiral.)

WEAVERS
=======================================================================

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Enchantress (12/3/5/2, Onhit Random Freeze 3) - Long-range freeze control
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

T2 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Rime Witch (+8 HP -> 20/3/5/2)
     Gains "Endturn Shatter [Range]": at end of turn, deal 4 damage to
     every frozen enemy within attack range. (Freeze-and-shatter combo.
     Hit to freeze 3 enemies, then shatter deals 4 to each frozen target
     = up to 12 bonus damage per turn. The Enchantress becomes a self-
     contained freeze-punish loop that rewards controlling more enemies.)

  2. Glacialist (+4 DMG, +1 Range -> 12/7/6/2)
     Gains "Onhit Root 2": target cannot move for 2 turns. Can still
     attack and use abilities if enemies are in range. (Different from
     Freeze: frozen units skip their turn entirely, rooted units can
     still fight but can't reposition. Pin a Shadowstep assassin and
     neutralize its mobility. Pin a tank and walk your army around it.)

  3. Wisp (+8 HP -> 20/3/5/2)
     Gains "Wounded Blink": when this unit takes damage, teleport to a
     random empty hex at least 4 hexes from the attacker. (The fragile
     Enchantress becomes untouchable. Every hit makes it vanish and
     reappear elsewhere. With range 5, it can usually still shoot from
     its new position. Assassins can reach it, but can never hold it.)

  4. Spellthief (+4 DMG -> 12/7/5/2)
     Gains "Onhit Dispel": remove all accumulated positive effects from
     the target - ramp damage, fortify HP, armor buffs, block charges.
     Target is reset to its base stats. (Anti-scaling. One hit undoes
     turns of careful stacking. Devastating against Ramp-heavy Purifier
     Penitents or Fortify armies. The ultimate counter to late-game
     scaling strategies.)

T3 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Permafrost (+16 HP)
     Gains "Passive Chill Aura [Range]": enemies within attack range
     cannot move more than 1 hex per turn (speed bonuses are suppressed).
     Additionally, at end of this unit's turn, deal 1 damage to all
     enemies within range. (Slow field. The entire enemy army crawls
     through the Permafrost's zone while taking guaranteed chip damage.
     Combined with Freeze, creates an inescapable control zone that
     stalls aggression indefinitely.)

  2. Dreamweaver (+16 HP)
     Gains "Endturn Polymorph": at end of turn, transform the lowest-HP
     enemy within range into a Husk (0 damage, retains current HP, loses
     all abilities) for 2 turns. After 2 turns, the original unit
     returns with its original stats. One Polymorph active at a time.
     (Removes a threat entirely for 2 turns. Polymorphing a wounded hero
     is devastating - it contributes nothing for 2 turns while its body
     blocks its own team. Creates rolling threat neutralization.)

  3. Fateweaver (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Onhit Trigger Allies 3": when this unit attacks, all allies
     within 3 hexes immediately fire their onhit abilities against a
     random enemy in their range. No actual attack occurs - only the
     onhit effect. (Orchestra conductor. One Fateweaver attack causes
     nearby Conduits to freeze, Seekers to ramp, Savants to splash.
     Allies get bonus onhit triggers without using their turn. Scales
     with how many onhit allies are nearby.)

  4. Phantom Queen (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Onkill Summon Phantom": when this unit kills an enemy, summon
     a Phantom at the dead enemy's location. Phantoms have 1 HP, 0 DMG,
     Range 6, and "Endturn Random Freeze 2". (Creates freeze turrets
     from kills. Each kill leaves a persistent freeze source deep in
     enemy lines. Even though Phantoms die to any hit, they fire their
     freeze before being cleaned up, creating persistent crowd control
     from behind enemy lines.)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Prodigy (8/8/4/2, Onhit Target Splash 3) - Glass cannon splash dealer
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

T2 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Resonator (+8 HP -> 16/8/4/2)
     Gains "Onhit Chain 4": after the initial attack, damage bounces to
     up to 2 additional enemies within 2 hexes of each previous target,
     dealing 4 damage per bounce. (Different from Splash. Splash hits
     everything adjacent to one target. Chain bounces sequentially to
     NEW targets further away. Combined with Splash 3, creates both wide
     and deep damage spread from a single attack.)

  2. Detonator (+4 DMG -> 8/12/4/2)
     Gains "Onkill Detonate": when killing an enemy, deal damage equal
     to half the killed unit's max HP to all enemies within 2 hexes of
     the corpse. (Enemies explode on death. Kill a 32 HP Mercenary and
     everything nearby takes 16 damage. Kill a 5 HP Penitent and the
     explosion is tiny. Devastating against clustered armies with high-HP
     units. Rewards targeting the biggest enemy first.)

  3. Hexshot (+4 DMG, +1 Range -> 8/12/5/2)
     Gains "Onhit Ricochet 2": after attacking, deal this unit's full
     damage to one additional random enemy within 2 hexes of the target.
     The ricochet hit also triggers Splash. (Two splash epicenters per
     attack. Primary target: 12 damage, neighbors take Splash 3.
     Ricochet target: 12 damage, ITS neighbors take Splash 3. Up to 8
     enemies damaged from a single attack at range 5.)

  4. Graviton (+8 HP -> 16/8/4/2)
     Gains "Onhit Pull 2": after attacking, pull the target 2 hexes
     closer to this unit. (Inverse of Push. A range-4 enemy is dragged
     to range 2 where most units can't retaliate. Pulls enemies out of
     formation, creates gaps in frontlines, and drags ranged enemies
     into uncomfortable close range.)

T3 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Worldbreaker (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Passive Double Strike": this unit attacks twice per turn,
     targeting a different random enemy each time. Each attack triggers
     all onhit abilities. (Two full attacks = two Splash triggers, two
     Chain bounces, two Pull effects. Doubles all offensive output. A
     16 DMG unit hitting twice with Splash 3 each time is 32 base damage
     plus up to 6 splash per turn.)

  2. Singularity (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Onhit Implosion 3": when attacking, pull all enemies within
     3 hexes of the TARGET 1 hex closer to the target's position.
     (Groups enemies around the impact point. Hit → enemies cluster
     around target → Splash 3 hits more of them. Self-setting combo.
     Each turn, the pack gets tighter, and the Splash gets deadlier.)

  3. Virtuoso (+16 HP)
     Gains "Passive Communion 4": this unit's damage increases by +1 for
     each allied unit within 4 hexes. (Scales with army density. With 6
     allies nearby: 14-16 damage plus Splash 3. Rewards keeping units
     alive and grouped. Creates an unusual tension: you want to cluster
     for damage, but clustering makes your army vulnerable to enemy AoE.)

  4. Stormcaller (+16 HP)
     Gains "Passive Lightning Rod 4": whenever an ally within 4 hexes
     takes damage from an attack, deal 2 damage to the attacker
     regardless of range. (Passive retribution field. Any enemy that
     attacks a nearby ally takes 2 automatic damage. At range 4, covers
     most of the army. Creates a dual threat: the Prodigy's own attacks
     deal splash offense, while the aura punishes enemies for attacking
     at all.)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scholar (16/3/5/2, Endturn Area Strike 1) - Long-range area chip damage
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

T2 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Occultist (+8 HP -> 24/3/5/2)
     Gains "Endturn Burn [Range] 2": at end of turn, all enemies within
     attack range gain Burn 2 (take 2 damage at the start of their next
     turn). Burns from multiple applications stack. (Compounding DOT.
     After 3 turns, enemies in range take 6 burn per turn on top of
     Area Strike 1. The Occultist creates an expanding fog of inevitable
     damage that armor cannot reduce.)

  2. Chronomancer (+4 DMG -> 16/7/5/2)
     Gains "Endturn Swap [Range]": at end of turn, swap positions with
     a random enemy within attack range. The swap occurs before Area
     Strike resolves. (Chaotic repositioning. The Scholar teleports into
     the enemy cluster, fires Area Strike 1 from inside it, and the
     displaced enemy is now stranded among your allies. Destabilizes
     both formations every single turn.)

  3. Nullifier (+4 DMG -> 16/7/5/2)
     Gains "Endturn Dispel Area [Range]": at end of turn, strip all
     accumulated buffs from enemies within range. Ramp damage, fortify
     HP, armor from abilities, and block charges are all removed. (Area
     anti-scaling. Ramp units return to base damage. Fortified units
     lose bonus HP. Resets every enemy in range to baseline every turn,
     making scaling strategies completely futile.)

  4. Channeler (+8 HP -> 24/3/5/2)
     Gains "Endturn Leech [Range]": at end of turn, drain 1 HP from
     each enemy within attack range and heal this unit for the total.
     (Area vampirism. With 5 enemies in range: 5 damage dealt, 5 HP
     healed per turn. Combined with Area Strike 1, each enemy takes
     2 per turn while the Scholar sustains itself indefinitely. Becomes
     nearly impossible to kill through attrition.)

T3 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Worldshaper (+16 HP)
     Gains "Endturn Create Pillar": create an impassable Pillar (10 HP,
     0 DMG, counts as neither ally nor enemy, blocks all movement) at a
     random empty hex adjacent to this unit. Max 3 Pillars at a time.
     (Terraforming. Builds walls that channel enemy movement, protect
     flanks, and create chokepoints. Over several turns, the battlefield
     geometry is reshaped entirely. Melee-heavy armies are funneled into
     kill zones.)

  2. Void Scholar (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Passive Magnetize Aura [Range]": enemies within attack range
     can only move TOWARD this unit, never away or laterally. (Absolute
     directional control. Once inside the 5-hex range, enemies are drawn
     inexorably inward with no possibility of retreat. Combined with
     Area Strike 1, enemies march into the damage field and can never
     escape it. A black hole.)

  3. Entropy Lord (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Endturn Decay [Range]": at end of turn, all enemies within
     range permanently lose 1 max HP AND 1 base damage. Current HP drops
     if above new max. (Combined wither and cripple. After 4 turns,
     every enemy in range has -4 HP and -4 damage. With Area Strike
     ticking simultaneously, the Scholar creates an area of total
     deterioration where enemies crumble in every dimension at once.)

  4. Aberration (+16 HP)
     Gains "Passive Mirror [Range]": whenever an enemy within attack
     range uses a triggered ability (onhit, endturn, onkill, wounded,
     lament, harvest), this unit copies that ability and fires it against
     a random enemy. (Turns enemy abilities against them. Enemy uses
     Freeze? You freeze them. Enemy uses Splash? You splash them. Enemy
     uses Heal? You heal an ally. Becomes more powerful the more ability-
     dense the enemy army is. The opponent's greatest strength becomes
     their worst liability.)

ARTIFICERS
=======================================================================

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Outcast (16/6/2/2, Turnstart Shadowstep Charge 4) - Mobile dive assassin
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

T2 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Bladedancer (+8 HP -> 24/6/2/2)
     Gains "Passive Riposte": when an adjacent enemy attacks this unit,
     automatically counter-attack that enemy for full damage. Triggers
     onhit abilities. Does not cost an action. (Shadowstep in, get
     attacked by surrounding enemies, counter-attack each one for free.
     With 24 HP, survives long enough to riposte several times. Turns
     the assassin into a melee deterrent that punishes engagement.)

  2. Infiltrator (+4 DMG, +1 Range -> 16/10/3/2)
     Gains "Onkill Vanish": after killing, become untargetable until this
     unit's next turn. (Kill and disappear. Shadowstep in, eliminate a
     fragile target, vanish from retaliation. If the kill attempt fails,
     you're fully exposed. Pure high-risk, high-reward assassination
     that rewards precision targeting and punishes bad reads.)

  3. Trapper (+4 DMG -> 16/10/2/2)
     Gains "Onhit Plant Mine": after attacking, place a Mine on a random
     empty hex adjacent to this unit. If an enemy starts its turn on a
     Mine hex, it detonates for 8 damage. Mines persist until triggered.
     Max 3 Mines active. (Creates a web of danger zones. Shadowstep
     around the battlefield leaving mines. Over time, movement becomes
     treacherous. Forces the enemy to track mine locations or suffer
     devastating surprise damage.)

  4. Brawler (+8 HP -> 24/6/2/2)
     Gains "Passive Momentum": if this unit moved this turn (including
     Shadowstep), its attack deals +4 bonus damage. (Shadowstep counts
     as movement. Every teleport-attack hits for 10 instead of 6. Turns
     that start without movement hit at base 6. Creates a clear rhythm:
     Shadowstep turns are devastating 10-damage strikes, stationary
     turns are normal attacks.)

T3 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Shade (+16 HP)
     Gains "Passive Phase Shift": after this unit acts each turn, teleport
     to a random empty hex at least 3 hexes from current position.
     (Automatic reposition after every action. Shadowstep IN -> attack ->
     teleport OUT. Nearly impossible to pin down or retaliate against.
     A ghost that materializes, strikes, and vanishes without any
     possibility of counterplay.)

  2. Reaver (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Onkill Chain Kill": when killing, immediately Shadowstep to
     the nearest enemy and attack again. Can chain up to 3 kills per
     turn. (Kill-chain assassin. Teleport, kill, teleport to next,
     kill, repeat. With high damage, cleans up 3 wounded enemies in a
     single turn. The ultimate snowball turn that can shatter an entire
     weakened army in one sequence.)

  3. Ghostblade (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Passive Phase Strike": this unit's attacks ignore all armor,
     Block, and damage reduction effects entirely. Full damage always
     lands. (Simple but devastating. A 14+ damage attack that cuts
     through Armor 5, Block 3, Damage Cap, everything. The Ghostblade
     is the ultimate answer to heavy defensive compositions. No amount
     of tanking protects against it.)

  4. Jailer (+16 HP)
     Gains "Onhit Shackle 3": target cannot move or use movement
     abilities (including Shadowstep, Blink, Phase Shift) for 3 turns.
     (Absolute pin. Shadowstep to an enemy hero, shackle it for 3 turns,
     and your army has a stationary target to focus down. Shuts down
     mobility heroes and prevents any form of retreat or repositioning.)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mercenary (32/3/2/2, 2x Endturn Random Strike 3) - Tanky bombarder
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

T2 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Ironhide (+8 HP -> 40/3/2/2)
     Gains "Passive Damage Cap 4": no single attack can deal more than
     4 damage to this unit after all reductions. Excess damage is simply
     ignored. (Immune to burst. A 20-damage hit deals only 4. Requires
     minimum 10 separate attacks to kill from full HP. The Ironhide can
     only be brought down through sustained chip damage across many
     turns, never a single devastating blow.)

  2. Disperser (+4 DMG -> 32/7/2/2)
     Gains "Endturn Scatter 3": at end of turn, push all enemies within
     3 hexes 1 hex away from this unit. (Mass displacement every turn.
     Keeps melee enemies at arm's length while Random Strikes chip them
     from afar. Disrupts enemy formations and prevents melee dogpiling.
     A breathing tank that maintains its space.)

  3. Siegemaster (+8 HP -> 40/3/2/2)
     Gains "Passive Ablative Shield 4": start combat with 4 Block
     charges. When all 4 charges are consumed, permanently gain +4
     damage for the rest of combat. (Two-phase tank. Phase 1: absorbs
     the first 4 hits completely. Phase 2: transforms into a damage
     dealer at 7 DMG + 2x Random Strike 3. A dramatic mid-combat power
     shift from shield wall to berserker.)

  4. Harpooner (+4 DMG -> 32/7/2/2)
     Gains "Endturn Grapple 6": at end of turn, pull the furthest enemy
     within 6 hexes 2 hexes closer to this unit. (Long-range hook. Drags
     backline ranged enemies toward the dangerous frontline where they're
     vulnerable. No one is safe at range. Combined with Random Strikes
     softening targets, the Harpooner reels in the wounded for the kill.)

T3 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Fortress (+16 HP)
     Gains "Passive Anchor Aura 3": allied units within 3 hexes cannot
     be pushed, pulled, swapped, displaced, or affected by any movement-
     altering abilities from enemies. (Anti-displacement zone. Protects
     your army's formation from Push, Pull, Vortex, Shadowstep chaos,
     Swap, and any other repositioning tricks. The Fortress makes your
     army formation permanent and unbreakable.)

  2. Marksman (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Endturn Guided Strike 6": at end of turn, deal 8 damage to
     the lowest-HP enemy within 6 hexes. (Targeted finisher on top of
     the existing Random Strikes. Random Strikes soften the field,
     Guided Strike executes the most wounded enemy. Creates a reliable
     kill pipeline every single turn. Nobody hides at low HP.)

  3. Bulwark (+16 HP)
     Gains "Lament Retaliate 2": when an allied unit within 2 hexes
     dies, this unit immediately attacks a random enemy in range. Triggers
     onhit abilities if any. (Death-triggered bonus attacks. Allies fall
     → Bulwark retaliates automatically. Combined with 2x Random Strike
     already firing each endturn, the Mercenary becomes a torrent of
     damage output when allies die nearby. Rewards expendable frontlines.)

  4. Devastator (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Endturn Global Strike 1": at end of turn, deal 1 damage to
     ALL enemies on the battlefield regardless of range or position.
     (Unavoidable. Unreduceable by armor. 1 damage to literally every
     enemy every turn. With 20 enemies, that's 20 total damage per turn.
     Combined with 2x Random Strike 3, creates inescapable attrition
     from any position. Nowhere on the map is safe.)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tactician (10/4/4/2, Passive Global Boost 1) - Ranged global support
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

T2 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Strategist (+8 HP -> 18/4/4/2)
     Gains "Passive Overwatch 4": whenever an enemy moves within this
     unit's attack range, deal 3 damage to that enemy. Triggers once per
     enemy per turn. (Defensive fire zone. Every approaching enemy takes
     free damage before it can even engage. Combined with Boost 1 for
     allies, creates a layered defense: enemies are softened by Overwatch,
     then hit harder by boosted allies.)

  2. Signaleer (+4 DMG -> 10/8/4/2)
     Gains "Passive Echo Boost": all allied triggered abilities (onhit,
     endturn, onkill, wounded, lament, harvest) have their effect values
     increased by +1. (Meta-buff. Freeze 3 becomes Freeze 4. Strike 3
     becomes Strike 4. Heal 2 becomes Heal 3. Armor Aura 2 becomes
     Armor Aura 3. A subtle but devastating force multiplier that makes
     every ability in the army slightly better.)

  3. Coordinator (+4 DMG, +1 Range -> 10/8/5/2)
     Gains "Endturn Reposition [Range]": at end of turn, swap the
     positions of any two allied units within attack range. (Formation
     manipulation without costing unit actions. Pull the injured tank
     to the back, push a fresh unit forward. Move the carry to optimal
     range. The Coordinator perfects army positioning every single turn.)

  4. Engineer (+8 HP -> 18/4/4/2)
     Gains "Endturn Deploy Turret": at end of turn, create a Turret
     adjacent to this unit. Turrets: 5 HP, 3 DMG, Range 4, no abilities,
     cannot move, act like normal units. Max 2 Turrets active at a time.
     (Creates static fire platforms. Combined with Boost 1, Turrets deal
     4 damage each. Two Turrets = 8 bonus damage per turn from protected
     positions. The Engineer builds an army within the army.)

T3 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Grandmaster (+16 HP)
     Gains "Passive Master Plan": at the start of combat, all allied
     units permanently gain +1 to every ability value: Freeze count,
     Strike damage, Heal amount, Armor value, Sunder amount, Splash
     damage, Summon count, Ramp value, etc. One-time buff. (Army-wide
     upgrade. Every single ability becomes strictly better. Combined with
     Boost 1 and Echo Boost if also present, creates an army where every
     unit significantly overperforms its stat line.)

  2. Fieldmarshal (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Passive Coordinated Assault": whenever this unit attacks an
     enemy, all other allies that have that same enemy within their
     attack range deal +2 damage to it until end of round. (Focus-fire
     coordinator. The Tactician shoots a target, painting it for the
     army. Every subsequent ally that can reach it hits +2 harder.
     Rewards concentration of fire and army-wide targeting coordination.)

  3. Architect (+16 HP)
     Gains "Endturn Construct Barricade": at end of turn, create a
     Barricade at a random empty hex within 3 hexes. Barricades are
     impassable, have 15 HP, can be attacked and destroyed, and count as
     neither ally nor enemy. Max 3 Barricades at a time. (Battlefield
     engineering. Build walls to channel enemy movement, protect flanks,
     and create chokepoints. Over several turns, the Architect creates
     a defensible position from nothing.)

  4. Warsmith (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Passive Range Aura 4": all allied units within 4 hexes gain
     +1 attack range. (Range extension. Melee units attack at range 2.
     Range-2 units attack at range 3. Range-4 units attack at range 5.
     Combined with Boost 1, the entire nearby army hits harder from
     further away. Transforms the army's engagement geometry.)

PURIFIERS
=======================================================================

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Maiden (8/3/5/2, Lament Area Strike 1 Charge 2) - Death-triggered ranged
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

T2 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Mourner (+8 HP -> 16/3/5/2)
     Gains "Lament Resurrect [Range]": when an allied unit dies within
     attack range, immediately resurrect it at 1 HP adjacent to this
     unit. Triggers once per round. (Instant rebirth. A Penitent dies,
     triggers Lament Strike charges, then is resurrected at 1 HP to
     fight again. Creates a loop of sacrifice and rebirth that maximizes
     the value of every Lament trigger.)

  2. Banshee (+4 DMG -> 8/7/5/2)
     Gains "Lament Wail [Range]": when an ally dies, all enemies within
     attack range permanently lose 1 base damage (minimum 0). (Each
     ally death weakens the entire enemy army. After 5 Penitent/Blade
     deaths, all enemies in range deal 5 less damage. The Purifier
     sacrifice engine doesn't just fuel your offense - it systematically
     dismantles theirs.)

  3. Seeress (+8 HP -> 16/3/5/2)
     Gains "Passive Sacrificial Aura [Range]": allied units within range
     that have 3 or fewer HP instantly die at the start of their turn,
     triggering all death effects (Lament, Harvest, etc.). (Accelerates
     the death engine. Low-HP Penitents and Blades don't waste turns
     attacking for 1 damage - they die immediately to fuel Lament
     triggers faster. Morbidly efficient. The Seeress culls the weak
     to empower the strong.)

  4. Prophetess (+4 DMG, +1 Range -> 8/7/6/2)
     Gains "Lament Chain 3 [Range]": when an ally dies, deal 3 damage to
     a random enemy within range. If that enemy dies, deal 3 to another
     random enemy, and so on until a target survives or none remain.
     (Chain reaction from death. Unlikely to chain far alone, but
     devastating against wounded armies. A single Penitent death could
     cascade into 2-3 additional kills if the enemy is softened, each
     kill potentially triggering further Lament effects.)

T3 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Matriarch (+16 HP)
     Gains "Lament Fortify Aura [Range] 2": when an ally dies within
     range, all OTHER allies within range gain +2 max HP permanently
     and heal 2. (Each death makes survivors tankier. After 5 ally
     deaths, all nearby allies have +10 max HP. The army becomes harder
     to attrition with every loss - you can never grind the Purifiers
     down because each loss makes the remainder tougher to kill.)

  2. Wrathqueen (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Lament Ready": when an allied unit dies (no charge), this
     unit becomes readied and can act again this round. No limit per
     round. (Unlimited extra actions from deaths. In a Purifier army
     where Blades and Penitents die constantly, the Wrathqueen could
     attack 3-5 times per round from range 5-6. A machine gun powered
     by sacrifice.)

  3. Deathmother (+16 HP)
     Gains "Lament Fission [Range]": when an ally within range dies,
     summon a 1-HP copy of that ally (retaining all abilities) adjacent
     to this unit. Copies created by Fission cannot trigger Fission on
     their own death. (Death creates replacements. Penitents die and
     respawn as 1-HP glass cannons with Wounded Ramp. Creates a steady
     stream of expendable bodies that each trigger Lament when they
     inevitably die again - without causing infinite loops.)

  4. Deathsinger (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Lament Drain [Range]": when an ally dies, deal 2 damage to
     every enemy within range and heal this unit for 2 per enemy hit.
     (Each ally death sprays area damage and heals the Deathsinger. With
     5 enemies in range, each death deals 10 total damage and heals 10.
     Combined with Lament Strike from charges, creates massive burst
     output per death event. Sacrifice fuels both offense and sustain.)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Aspirant (32/4/1/2, Onhit Splash 4, Passive Armor 1) - Armored melee splash
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

T2 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Berserker (+4 DMG -> 32/8/1/2)
     Gains "Passive Blood Frenzy": at the start of each of this unit's
     turns, take 2 self-damage and permanently gain +1 damage. (Self-
     destructing powerhouse. After 10 turns: 12 HP remaining but 18 DMG
     with Splash 4. Eventually kills itself but becomes monstrous before
     it does. Self-damage may also trigger Wounded abilities from T3 or
     upgrades, creating further synergy.)

  2. Templar (+8 HP -> 40/4/1/2)
     Gains "Onhit Shockwave 1": after attacking, push ALL enemies within
     1 hex of this unit 1 hex away. (AoE knockback on every attack.
     The 40 HP tank clears space around itself each hit, shattering
     enemy clusters and preventing dogpiling. Different from Push:
     Push displaces the target, Shockwave scatters everyone nearby.)

  3. Vindicator (+8 HP -> 40/4/1/2)
     Gains "Passive Retaliation 3": whenever an adjacent enemy attacks
     this unit, deal 3 damage to that enemy automatically. Does not cost
     an action. (Passive counter-attacks. Every melee enemy that swings
     at the Vindicator takes 3 damage for free. With 40 HP and Armor 1,
     it survives long enough to retaliate many times. A thorny wall that
     makes melee engagement painful.)

  4. Shieldbreaker (+4 DMG -> 32/8/1/2)
     Gains "Onhit Shatter": if the target has armor, deal bonus damage
     equal to double the target's total effective armor, then reduce
     their armor to 0. (Anti-tank specialist. A Golem with Armor 2
     takes +4 bonus and loses all armor. A Watcher with Armor 5 takes
     +10 bonus and is stripped bare. Combined with Splash 4, devastates
     armored formations.)

T3 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Judicator (+16 HP)
     Gains "Passive Gravity Well 2": enemies within 2 hexes cannot move
     away from this unit. They can move laterally or closer but never
     increase their distance. (Inescapable. The 48-56 HP armored tank
     locks down everything in melee range permanently. Combined with
     Splash 4, trapped enemies eat splash damage every turn with zero
     possibility of retreat. Engage the Judicator and you're committed.)

  2. Doomguard (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Onhit Condemn": the target takes 2 damage at the end of each
     of its turns for the rest of combat. Multiple Condemn applications
     on the same target stack. (Permanent DOT. Hit a target twice and
     it takes 4 burn per turn forever. Combined with Splash 4, the
     primary target rots from accumulated DOT while neighbors take splash.
     Kills through patience.)

  3. Annihilator (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Passive Cleave": this unit's basic attack hits ALL adjacent
     enemies for full damage, not just a random target. Each hit triggers
     onhit abilities. (Full damage to everyone in melee range. At 12+
     DMG with T3 stats, that's 12 damage to every adjacent enemy every
     turn. Splash 4 still applies to each hit target's neighbors. A
     melee blender that punishes any clustering near it.)

  4. Immortal (+16 HP)
     Gains "Passive Adaptation": the first time this unit takes damage
     each round, permanently gain +1 armor. The second time, permanently
     gain +1 damage. The third time and beyond, heal 4. (Rewards being
     focused. Getting hit 3 times in a round gives +1 armor, +1 damage,
     AND 4 healing. The Aspirant's massive HP pool ensures it survives
     long enough to stack many times. A unit that grows stronger the
     more it is attacked.)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Apostle (12/2/3/2, Passive Lament Aura 1 Range 1 Aura R) - Death aura support
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

T2 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Confessor (+8 HP -> 20/2/3/2)
     Gains "Passive Life Link Aura [Range]": damage dealt to allies
     within aura range is split: the ally takes half (rounded down), this
     unit takes the other half (rounded up). (Damage sharing tank. Keeps
     allies alive longer by absorbing half their incoming damage. Creates
     an interesting tension with Lament Aura: protecting allies delays
     their deaths and thus delays Lament triggers. The player must choose
     when to shield and when to let allies fall.)

  2. Inciter (+4 DMG -> 12/6/3/2)
     Gains "Lament Frenzy 3": when an ally within 3 hexes dies, all
     OTHER allies within 3 hexes immediately make a bonus attack against
     a random enemy in their range. (Death triggers army-wide retaliation.
     A Penitent dies -> every nearby ally swings immediately. Combined
     with Lament Aura giving +1 damage per death, creates cascading
     violence where each death is answered by a boosted volley of
     retaliatory strikes.)

  3. Vessel (+4 DMG -> 12/6/3/2)
     Gains "Endturn Leech Aura [Range]": at end of turn, steal 1 HP from
     each enemy within attack range (deal 1 damage and heal 1 per enemy).
     (Passive area drain. With 4 enemies in range: 4 damage dealt, 4 HP
     healed per turn. The Vessel steadily drains life from enemies while
     Lament Aura powers up allies from deaths. Sustain through vampirism
     that doesn't depend on kills or deaths.)

  4. Beacon (+8 HP -> 20/2/3/2)
     Gains "Passive Lament Echo Aura [Range]": whenever a Lament ability
     triggers on ANY unit within aura range, it triggers a second time.
     (Meta-amplifier. Avenger's Lament Ramp 1 becomes effectively Ramp
     2 per death. Maiden's Lament Strike triggers twice per death. The
     Apostle's own Lament Aura applies twice. The Beacon does nothing
     by itself but doubles the output of the entire Purifier death
     engine.)

T3 EVOLUTIONS:

  1. Absolver (+16 HP)
     Gains "Lament Full Heal [Range]": when an ally within aura range
     dies, all OTHER allies within range are healed to full HP. (Massive
     restoration from each death. A Penitent dies and every nearby ally
     is completely restored. Makes the army impossible to grind down:
     every death undoes all accumulated damage on the survivors. Only
     burst kills can stick.)

  2. Hierophant (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Lament Convert 3": track ally deaths within aura range.
     After every 3rd death, the nearest enemy within 3 hexes permanently
     switches sides (becomes allied at full HP with all abilities).
     Counter resets after conversion. (Enemies defect when they witness
     enough sacrifice. Lose 3 expendable Penitents, gain a full-strength
     enemy unit. In a Blade/Penitent-heavy army, conversions happen
     disturbingly often.)

  3. Arch-Prelate (+16 HP)
     Gains "Passive Death Clock Aura [Range]": track total ally deaths
     within aura range (accumulates, never resets). When the count
     reaches 5, deal 20 damage to ALL enemies on the battlefield and
     reset the counter. (Doomsday device. 5 ally deaths = army-wide
     nuke. In a Purifier army with expendable Blades and Penitents,
     reaching 5 is easy. Then 20 damage to EVERYTHING. Can trigger
     multiple times per combat if enough allies keep dying.)

  4. Soulkeeper (+8 DMG)
     Gains "Passive Soul Harvest Aura [Range]": when an allied unit
     within aura range dies, this unit permanently gains all of that
     dead ally's abilities for the rest of combat. (Accumulates power
     from the fallen. Penitent dies -> gain Wounded Ramp 1. Priest dies
     -> gain Endturn Heal 3. Avenger dies -> gain Lament Ramp 1. Herald
     dies -> gain Endturn Summon. The Soulkeeper becomes a repository of
     every fallen ally's power, growing more versatile with each death.)
