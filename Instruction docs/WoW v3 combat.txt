Wager of War v3 combat


Mechanics
* Map is made of hexes and is split into 2 equal portions west-to-east with a bit of neutral territory between them
* Player 1’s units start on random hexes in the western portion, Player 2’s units start on random squares in the eastern portion and the middle portion starts empty
* Each unit gets assigned a random order in which they take their turn
* When it’s a unit’s turn, it follows the following protocol:
   * If there is at least 1 enemy in range, attack a random enemy in range
   * If not, move towards the closest enemy unit
      * If several enemies are equidistant, move towards a random one
   * If this brings the unit within range of at least 1 enemy, attack a random enemy in range
* Once all units have taken a turn, the order gets randomized again and the process repeats
* A unit has three attributes: its Max Health, Damage and Range
   * Its Current Health is also tracked once a battle has started
* If a unit’s Health reaches 0, that unit dies and no longer takes any actions
