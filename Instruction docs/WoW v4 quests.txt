Quests
Each faction starts with 3 quests. Whenever a quest is issued it gets a location on the map which only the faction can see. The location is somewhat random, but always follows some rule defined by the specific quest. To be completed, a quest always requires a specific hero to be brought to the location.


After doing so, the player gets a choice between 2 options. Each option has a benefit for the hero that was required for the quest and some other benefit - either a permanent upgrade for the entire faction, a permanent upgrade for some unit of the faction or some instant one-off benefit.
